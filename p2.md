## Storyboard

The main idea that we took from our brainstorming activity was the sketch of our systems main hub.  Our storyboard builds upon the use of this main hub, which we like to call the "tile menu", for how a user would navigate around our system.  Our tile screen will always have four options to choose from.  From the main tile menu, users can access settings, a search tool, favourites, and their home screen.  Also, a user can swipe down to get two more options on the tile screen.  Essentially, from this main tile screen a user can go to any four branches of our system that they want.  For example, lets say a user wants to visit a website already saved into their favourites list.  The user would click the favourites option, which would transfer them to a screen showing two large icons to either save a website, or list their favourites.  Once the list favourites option was selected a user can browse all the saved websites they have and select the icon associated with that website.  After being redirected to the website, the user can click the upper left corner tile button to return themselves to the main tile menu.  This is only one of many tasks a user could do using the main tile menu we have created for our system.

## Task-Centered System Walkthrough

Adam is a 20 year old affected by cerebral palsy, which limits the use of his non dominant hand. He wants to go to the movie theatre, but wants to watch the trailers online to decide on which movie to watch before he goes.

Chris is a married 50 year old who shares a computer with his wife, Diana. Chris has cerebral palsy, and uses a specially designed web browser. He has been browsing online stores for a gift for his wife’s birthday, but wants to clear the browser history so that Diana doesn’t know what he is getting for her.

John is a 40 year old man with a moderate movement disorder -- a tremor, and he has a hard time hitting targets less than an inch wide. He finds a website while browsing, and thinks he may like to visit it again frequently in the future.

## Brainstorm and Affinity Diagram

We sketched out potential solutions and grouped them in rough categories (eg. hardware, UI, etc.). Each of us came up with 4-5 designs. The ideas were fairly similar but had minor differences, since based on user research we found that there were a few specific challenges with our user group we needed to solve. Then we took the best elements of each category and iterated on those ideas. 

The first image showcases a simple voice command browsing interface that is always available throughout the system. Based on user research, word insertion was one of the challenges and having a voice command interface eliminates the use of a keyboard for word entry.

Next, the second image shows a favourites system that provides easier access to favourited websites. The websites are represented with large icons so that they are easy to recognize.

Lastly, the third image presents the "main hub" of the browser where the user can easily accomplish various tasks by navigating large, colored tile menu options. The tiles take up a large portion of the screen so that they are easy to select, and are colored so that the user can better see the options with peripheral vision.

## Reflection

Our brainstorming session was very productive and led to a lot of progress on our design as well as new insights into what aspects we considered important.

Probably the most helpful activity that really spring boarded our the beginning of what is now our design was the affinity diagramming session. This showed us, via the similar category of ideas, that we were all on the same page about what we wanted and allowed us to easily pick the best UI designs out of these well defined categories.

The exercise that we found the least effective was the story-boarding. We didn't garner any new knowledge or come up with any new design decisions we hadn't already thought of. It was still good practice, but the least effective of the strategy's.

If we were to do this exercise again we would try to plan out our video prototype better and improve the paper components to better demonstrate and showcase our design.

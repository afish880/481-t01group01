# P1: User ResearchProject Idea
 
Our project idea is to develop a web browser targeted specifically towards individuals afflicted with cerebral palsy. People with cerebral palsy tend to have issues with fine motor functions with widely varying degrees of severity and as such have trouble navigating many kinds of user interfaces and among them web browsers that are designed to maximize the webpage estate, making many buttons and other interactive features smaller as a result and often shoving them out of the way or hiding them behind multiple high-focus clicks (clicks that even for everyday users may require moving a mouse with high accuracy or tapping a tiny icon). This is a very functional design decision for general users but a major hindrance for those with disabilities. Our design goal is to bring the most popular features of a web browser front and center in a way that makes it easy for those with this disorder to browse the web easily and comfortably.
 
We expect the system to be used as one would any other web browser; to quickly check information online or for casual browsing during free time. We expect our browser to be mostly used in homes under relaxed conditions where the user can comfortably navigate their favourite websites without feeling under pressure. This means we won’t be putting heavy emphasis on quick access to features, but rather on the ease of accessing those features without having to exert excessive concentration or focus. Of course we’d still like the user to be able to look things up quickly so some features might have a higher priority of use than others, such as bookmarks and web search, but as a whole our main goal for the system is the aforementioned ease of use over speed of use. 
 

Part - 2: Identify stakeholders and users (Aaron Fisher)
 
As our system aims to be for people afflicted by cerebral palsy, to adequately describe our users we feel it  it is necessary to give a short explanation of what cerebral palsy is for those who may not know. 
 
“Cerebral palsy is an umbrella term that refers to a group of disorders affecting a person’s ability to move. It is due to damage to the developing brain either during pregnancy or shortly after birth. Cerebral palsy affects people in different ways and can affect body movement, muscle control, muscle coordination, muscle tone, reflex, posture and balance. Although cerebral palsy is a permanent life-long condition, some of these signs of cerebral palsy can improve or worsen over time. People who have cerebral palsy may also have visual, learning, hearing, speech, epilepsy and intellectual impairments.”

The users of our system are people afflicted with cerebral palsy, their families (who may not have cerebral palsy), healthcare professionals working with cerebral palsy patients. Other stakeholders include, other medical specialists, and financial backers. For each type of user we will describe the use case, motivation, and experience level of each.
 
People afflicted by cerebral palsy:
This is our main user group and who the design will be focused around. Due to the nature of the disease it is hard to say what level of impairment they may have, and what level of experience they will have with traditional browsers as their functionality may have limited their use to this point. As well range of fine/coarse motor function and coordination they possess will vary greatly on a case by case basis.
 
Families of cerebral palsy patients:
People who live with cerebral palsy patients may use shared devices with them so we want our system to be accessible for them as well. They are most likely well experienced with traditional browsers, so it is important that our system be understandable to them as well.
 
professionals working with cerebral palsy patients:
Similarly to family members there may be others around sufferers of cerebral palsy who may end up being users of f our system, and they too will most likely be accustomed to currently available browser systems.
 
 
 
Part 3 - Taylor Stemp
Since we are creating a web browser for people that have cerebral palsy, we felt a personal face to face meeting was the best way to gather information concerning what this group of people are looking for in a web browser.  We decided to use the IDEO methods of Observation, Think-Aloud, and Interviewing to gather this information.
 
Observation
Having the opportunity to be inside the environment where our subjects would be using our product and observing them, we felt would give us a good idea of how they use typical web browsers and the benefits and drawbacks that came with using those browsers.  We asked our subject to perform different tasks regarding the use of a conventional web browser.  Tasks like going to a specific website, finding bookmarks and going into their settings to clear their browser history gave us a breadth of information regarding different tasks.  An interesting observation was seen when going to a specific website, that the use of Google as a search engine was used.  The use of a two finger trackpad scroll up and down was used often as a tool to move conveniently around a webpage.  Lastly, a built-in voice command tool was used to sign into Netflix using the subjects email to eliminate the difficulty of typing an entire email address out.  In summary, the use of regular tools such as, two finger scrolling and Google search were used often to navigate through the browsers which shows a similarity between our intended users and everyday users of conventional web browsers.  However, the voice command tool is a resource not used by many, that created a virtual typing experience for our subject.


Think-Aloud Method
	We felt using the Think-Aloud method was essential into understanding our subjects thoughts and reasonings while going through their current browser.  Being able to ask questions to our subject as to their rationale behind why they used certain features helps understand their reasoning more accurately.  As said previously, the use of Google search was prominent when tasked to go to a specific website.  When questioned why this is the case, our subject stated it was easier and provided him with suggested search options which helped.  The use of voice command was consistently used for simplicity and cut time.  Although voice command was used for specific website searches, it was partially used by our subject when asked to put in his email for a website.  This is because he stated that the voice command software spaces out his words which doesn’t fit the concatenated design of a email address.  Additionally, he stated that specifying lowercase from uppercase was not existent on his laptop.  Finally, when asked to find a movie on Netflix, he used a categorical search rather than a typical text based search stating that it was easier to browse through categories to find the movie he needed.
 
 
Interviewing
	The use of interviews is relative in this context, because we believe in order to get direct feedback about certain web browsers used by people with cerebral palsy, asking them questions is a good way to highlight things that work, and things that don’t.  During our interview, our subject stated that unfamiliarity with certain browsers, such as Google Chrome, creates for more difficulty when going through a web page.  Our subject has Apple products which allow for Safari to be a comfortable and familiar experience.  Secondly, when asked about features that would well for our subject, he stated that the use of voice command and playback is critical when navigating browsers either on a laptop, or mobile phone.  Additionally, our subject stated the use of contrasting colours made text easier to read and tracking more straightforward.  Lastly, our subject used the term “tracking” frequently during the interview, saying that for him he looks for familiar symbols, icons, and colours to be able to help him maneuver through a web browser more smoothly.
 
 
	Being able to use all of these methods in tandem with one another has given us some very interesting and insightful information as to what features are important for our specified group, and which are not.  Given all of this data we can now begin to ideate some potential designs and features for our web browser.
 

4 - Task Descriptions
Our system aims to improve the web browsing experience of those dealing with cerebral palsy. The target audience will be using the system as a web browser, and will perform tasks similar, if not identical, to people not affected by cerebral palsy. Such tasks include but are not limited to: navigating to a specific web page, modifying browser settings, adding and using bookmarks. The design of these tasks should not hinder the use of the system by people not affected with cerebral palsy, in the case that the computer is shared like in a household. 
 
Navigation (by URL)
The user enters the URL into the navigation bar of the browser. Suggestions of webpages of the same URL may appear (browser history of popular webpages other users have visited), from which the user can select or continue to enter the specific URL of the webpage. If the user selects a suggestion, the browser will go to the corresponding webpage, and if the user enters the full URL, the browser first looks for a web page at the address before loading it.
Navigation (by search words)
The user enters keywords of the desired webpage to navigate to into the search bar (may be built into the navigation bar like some existing browsers, or be a separate search engine such as Google). Suggestions are provided based on previous searches and/or popular searches by other users. The user can select one of the suggestions, or perform a search using the keywords they have entered. Once searching, a list of links relevant to the search words are provided, from which the user selects to navigate to the corresponding webpage.
Modifying Settings
The user enters the browser setting menu. The menu is divided into broad categories, which narrow down options. Similar to web page navigation, there may be a search bar that allows the user to enter keywords specifying the desired setting.
Bookmarks
The user opens the bookmarks menu/bar and selects the option of adding a bookmark. The current web page’s information may be autofilled, otherwise the user can enter the URL and name of the bookmark manually. 
To go to a bookmark, the user opens the bookmarks menu and selects the bookmark.
To modify a bookmark, the user may open the bookmark menu and then the modify button, which allows the user to change the URL and/or the name of the bookmark.
